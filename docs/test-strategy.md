# Aktina SCM Test Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive test strategy for the Aktina Supply Chain Management system. The strategy covers different testing levels, methodologies, and tools to ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the application.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Scope**: Individual classes, methods, and functions
- **Focus**: Service layer business logic, repositories, models
- **Tools**: PHPUnit, Pest
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical business logic

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Interactions between components and services
- **Focus**: Service-Repository interactions, database operations
- **Tools**: PHPUnit, Pest, Laravel Testing Framework
- **Coverage Target**: All service-repository interactions

### 3. Feature Testing
- **Scope**: User workflows and features
- **Focus**: End-to-end functionality from controller to view
- **Tools**: Laravel Testing Framework, Pest
- **Coverage Target**: All critical user workflows

### 4. UI/Component Testing
- **Scope**: Livewire components, blade views
- **Focus**: Component interactions, state management, reactivity
- **Tools**: Livewire Testing Utilities, Browser Testing
- **Coverage Target**: All interactive UI components

### 5. Performance Testing
- **Scope**: System performance under load
- **Focus**: Response times, database query efficiency
- **Tools**: Laravel Debug Bar, Blackfire.io
- **Metrics**: Response time < 300ms, query count optimization

### 6. Security Testing
- **Scope**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Focus**: Access control, input validation, CSRF protection
- **Tools**: PHPUnit, manual testing, OWASP guidelines
- **Coverage**: All authenticated routes and API endpoints

## Testing Environments

### 1. Local Development
- PHPUnit tests run locally before commits
- Environment: .env.testing configuration
- Database: Separate test database (MySQL)

### 2. Continuous Integration
- Automated test runs on GitHub Actions
- Environment: Clean testing environment per run
- Database: In-memory SQLite for speed

### 3. Staging
- Full test suite run before production deployment
- Environment: Mirror of production
- Database: Clone of production data (anonymized)

## Test Data Management

### 1. Factories & Seeders
- Use model factories for test data generation
- Create comprehensive data seeders for system testing
- Implement state transformations for different test scenarios

### 2. Database Transactions
- Use database transactions to isolate tests
- Reset database state between test runs
- Use in-memory database where possible for speed

## Testing Conventions

### 1. Naming Conventions
- Unit tests: `test_[method_name]_[expected_behavior]`
- Feature tests: `test_[feature]_[scenario]_[expected_outcome]`
- Test classes: `[Feature/Unit][ComponentName]Test`

### 2. Test Organization
- Group related tests in test classes
- Use descriptive docblocks for test methods
- Separate test data setup from assertions

### 3. Assertions
- Use expressive assertions for readability
- Prioritize specific assertions over generic ones
- Assert only what is necessary for the test case

## Test Automation & CI/CD

### 1. Continuous Integration
- Run tests on every pull request
- Block merges on test failures
- Generate and publish test coverage reports

### 2. Continuous Deployment
- Run full test suite before deployment
- Deploy automatically on test success
- Implement rollback procedures for test failures

## Quality Metrics

### 1. Code Coverage
- Line coverage: 75% minimum overall
- Class coverage: 90% for core services
- Branch coverage: 70% for conditional logic

### 2. Performance Metrics
- API response time: < 300ms average
- Page load time: < 1s for main workflows
- Query count: < 10 queries per main request

### 3. Security Metrics
- 0 high or critical vulnerabilities
- All input validated and sanitized
- Complete authentication/authorization coverage

## Test Reporting

### 1. Test Results
- Generate JUnit XML reports
- Publish results to CI/CD dashboard
- Alert on test failures via Slack/email

### 2. Coverage Reports
- Generate HTML coverage reports
- Track coverage trends over time
- Highlight untested code sections

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up testing environments
- Configure CI/CD pipeline
- Establish baseline tests

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Coverage
- Implement missing unit tests
- Create feature tests for main workflows
- Add integration tests for service interactions

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing
- Implement performance testing
- Enhance security testing
- Add UI/component testing

### Phase 4: Automation & Monitoring
- Automate all testing processes
- Implement continuous monitoring
- Establish quality dashboards
