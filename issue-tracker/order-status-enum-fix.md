# Order Status Enum Database Fix

## Issue
- Order acceptance was failing with SQL error: "Column not found: 1054 Unknown column"
- Database enum only supported 3 status values: 'pending', 'accepted', 'complete'
- Order model defined many more status constants that weren't supported by database schema

## Root Cause
- Original migration only created enum with limited values
- Application code tried to use status values not defined in database enum

## Solution
- Created migration `2025_07_10_144737_update_orders_status_enum.php`
- Updated enum to support all status values defined in Order model:
  - pending, accepted, rejected, processing, partially_fulfilled
  - fulfilled, shipped, in_transit, delivered, complete
  - cancelled, returned, fulfillment_failed

## Files Modified
- `database/migrations/2025_07_10_144737_update_orders_status_enum.php` (created)

## Related Fixes
- Fixed product price display in order detail table (product_id cast to int)
- Fixed employee loading for both pending and accepted order statuses

## Status
âœ… RESOLVED - Migration applied successfully
