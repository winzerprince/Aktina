# Vendor Order Fulfillment Structure Fix

## Issue Description
The vendor order fulfillment Blade template had inconsistencies between the version in the editor context and the version in the actual workspace. The editor version appeared to have incorrect nesting and missing sections, specifically:

1. Missing header section
2. Missing error and success message sections
3. Missing progress bar section
4. Incomplete step conditionals
5. Incomplete div closure

## Root Cause
The issue appears to be related to how the file is being rendered in the editor context, not in the actual file on disk. The actual file structure in the workspace is correct.

## Resolution
After thorough analysis, I confirmed that the vendor-order-fulfillment.blade.php file in the workspace has the correct structure with:

1. Properly nested and closed `@if`, `@elseif`, `@switch` directives
2. All required divs are properly closed
3. Step navigation is correctly implemented
4. All conditional steps are properly structured

No changes were needed to the actual file since it already had the correct implementation.

## Recommendations
1. When experiencing UI issues with the order fulfillment wizard, verify by running a manual test to ensure the structure renders correctly in the browser.
2. The file structure is complex with multiple nested conditionals - consider adding comments to mark the end of major sections for better code readability.
