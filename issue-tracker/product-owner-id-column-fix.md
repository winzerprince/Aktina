# Product Owner ID Column Error Fix

## Issue Description
**Error**: `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'owner_id' in 'WHERE'`
**Location**: `app/Services/InventoryService.php:130`
**Context**: Vendor dashboard testing

## Root Cause
The database schema was refactored to remove the `owner_id` column from the `products` table and replace it with a `company_quantities` JSON field for company-based product ownership tracking. However, the `InventoryService::getTotalProductsByVendor()` method still uses the old `owner_id` approach.

## Database Schema Changes
- **OLD**: `products.owner_id` (foreign key to users table)
- **NEW**: `products.company_quantities` (JSON field: `{"CompanyName": {"quantity": 100, "updated_at": "2025-07-10"}}`)

## Fix Applied
Updated `InventoryService::getTotalProductsByVendor()` to use the new company-based approach:
- Query products where `company_quantities` JSON contains the vendor's company name
- Use proper JSON query syntax for MySQL

## Files Modified
- `app/Services/InventoryService.php` - Line 130

## Testing Required
- Manual test of vendor dashboard to verify the fix works
- Ensure other inventory-related methods are not affected

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Updated method to use company-based product ownership system
