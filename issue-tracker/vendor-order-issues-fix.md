# Vendor Order Issues Fix Plan

## Issues Identified

1. **Orders not showing for vendor@gmail.com**
   - Need to verify if orders are being created with this specific vendor as seller
   - Check if orders exist in database with correct seller_id

2. **Stock validation preventing order creation**
   - Current checkProductStockLevels() in OrderRepository is a placeholder
   - Always returns true if product exists but may have warnings
   - Need to implement proper company-based stock checking using new `company_quantities` system

3. **Vendor should be able to create orders regardless of Aktina stock**
   - Vendors are sellers, they should have their own inventory
   - Stock checks should be based on vendor's company inventory, not Aktina's

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Database Schema Change Impact**: The migration from `owner_id` to `company_quantities` JSON field affected stock checking logic
2. **Stock Validation Logic**: Current implementation doesn't properly handle company-based inventory
3. **Order Creation Logic**: May be preventing vendors from creating orders due to incorrect stock validation

## Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Stock Validation
1. Update OrderRepository::checkProductStockLevels() to use company_quantities
2. Implement proper company-based stock checking
3. Allow vendors to create orders based on their own inventory

### Phase 2: Ensure Order Visibility
1. Verify order seeding includes vendor@gmail.com as seller
2. Check if existing orders are properly associated with vendor
3. Test order list component filtering

### Phase 3: Create Tests
1. Unit tests for stock checking logic
2. Feature tests for vendor order creation
3. Integration tests for order visibility

## Files to Modify
- `app/Repositories/OrderRepository.php` - Fix checkProductStockLevels()
- `database/seeders/OrderSeeder.php` - Ensure vendor orders exist
- Create tests for verification

## Status
- **COMPLETED ✅** - All issues fixed and verified with tests

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Stock Validation (✅ COMPLETED)
- **File**: `app/Repositories/OrderRepository.php`
- **Issue**: Placeholder stock checking logic that always returned true
- **Fix**: Implemented proper company-based stock checking using `company_quantities` JSON field
- **Impact**: Vendors can now create orders based on their company's inventory

### 2. Fixed Order Visibility (✅ COMPLETED)
- **File**: `database/seeders/OrderSeeder.php`
- **Issue**: No guaranteed orders for vendor@gmail.com user
- **Fix**: Added specific order creation for vendor user as seller (5 pending, 3 accepted, 2 completed)
- **Impact**: Vendor dashboard now shows relevant orders

### 3. Fixed View Errors (✅ COMPLETED)
- **File**: `resources/views/livewire/vendor/vendor-order-management.blade.php`
- **Issues**: 
  - Accessing `$order->user` instead of `$order->buyer`
  - Using non-existent `total_amount` field instead of `price`
  - Using non-existent `order_items_count` instead of `items_count`
- **Fixes**:
  - Changed `$order->user` to `$order->buyer` with null safety
  - Changed `total_amount` to `price` 
  - Changed `order_items_count` to `items_count`
- **Impact**: View renders without errors, shows correct buyer information

### 4. Created Comprehensive Tests (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Files**: `tests/Feature/VendorOrderTest.php`, `tests/Unit/OrderStockCheckTest.php`
- **Coverage**:
  - Vendor can see their orders page
  - Stock validation uses company quantities
  - Vendor can create orders with available stock
  - Order management component displays correctly
- **Results**: All 5 tests passing (15 assertions)

## Verification
- ✅ Tests created and passing
- ✅ Stock validation fixed
- ✅ Order visibility ensured
- ✅ View errors resolved
- ✅ Company-based inventory system working
