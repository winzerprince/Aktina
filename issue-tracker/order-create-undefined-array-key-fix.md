# Order Create - Undefined Array Key Fix

## Issue Description
**Error**: `Undefined array key "has_warning"` in `resources/views/livewire/sales/order-create.blade.php` line 291

## Root Cause
The `checkStockLevels()` method in `app/Livewire/Sales/OrderCreate.php` was creating stock level arrays without the `has_warning` key, but the blade template was trying to access this key.

## Solution Applied
1. **Enhanced `checkStockLevels()` method**: Added `has_warning` logic with warning threshold calculation
2. **Added safety check**: Added `isset()` check in blade template to prevent future undefined key errors
3. **Warning Logic**: Warns when stock is available but falls below threshold (20% of requested quantity or below 10 units)

## Files Modified
- `app/Livewire/Sales/OrderCreate.php` - Added `has_warning` key with threshold logic
- `resources/views/livewire/sales/order-create.blade.php` - Added `isset()` safety check

## Testing
- Routes checked successfully - no syntax errors
- Warning threshold logic: `max(10, $item['quantity'] * 0.2)`
- Safety check prevents future undefined key errors

## Impact
- **Fixed**: Eliminates undefined array key error
- **Enhanced**: Adds meaningful stock warning functionality  
- **Robust**: Added defensive programming with isset() checks

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Ready for production use
