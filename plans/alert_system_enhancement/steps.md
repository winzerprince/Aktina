# Alert System Enhancement Plan

## Goal
Enhance the Aktina SCM system's alert capabilities with advanced features including email notifications, order approval notifications, system performance monitoring, and custom threshold management.

## Technical Approach
Implement a dedicated AlertEnhancementService that builds on the existing alert infrastructure to provide more sophisticated notification capabilities, performance monitoring, and threshold management.

### Step 1: Code Exploration and Analysis
1.1. Review existing alert-related code and functionality
1.2. Identify integration points and dependencies
1.3. Determine required interfaces and models

### Step 2: Core Service Implementation
2.1. Create AlertEnhancementService
2.2. Implement inventory alert email notifications
2.3. Implement order approval notification system
2.4. Implement system performance monitoring and alerts
2.5. Implement custom threshold management

### Step 3: Supporting Models and Migrations
3.1. Create SystemPerformance model
3.2. Generate and customize migration for system_performances table
3.3. Define relationships and methods

### Step 4: Notification Classes
4.1. Create OrderApprovalRequest notification
4.2. Create SystemPerformanceAlert notification
4.3. Enhance existing LowStockAlert notification

### Step 5: UI Components for Threshold Management
5.1. Create AlertThresholdManager Livewire component
5.2. Create Blade view for threshold management
5.3. Implement threshold editing functionality

### Step 6: System Integration
6.1. Register service in service provider
6.2. Add routes for threshold management
6.3. Create controller methods
6.4. Add system performance dashboard
6.5. Update navigation with new menu items

### Step 7: Testing
7.1. Create feature tests for AlertEnhancementService
7.2. Create factories for testing
7.3. Test UI components and navigation

## Success Criteria
- Administrators receive email notifications for inventory alerts
- Order approval workflow includes notifications to approvers
- System performance is monitored with threshold-based alerts
- Administrators can customize alert thresholds
- All features are properly integrated into the admin interface
- Feature tests ensure functionality works correctly
