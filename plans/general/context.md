## Major Refactoring Initiative: Product Ownership System (In Planning - July 2025)

**Product Ownership Refactoring - MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE**

A comprehensive refactoring initiative to implement company-based product ownership and inventory tracking:

**Key Changes:**
- Product ownership will be tracked by company rather than individual users
- JSON-based company quantity tracking: `{"Aktina": {"quantity": 100, "updated_at": "2025-07-10"}}`
- Total product quantity will be calculated dynamically from company quantities
- Order displays will show company names primarily with individual names as secondary info
- Automatic inventory transfers between companies during order processing

**Impact Areas:**
- Database schema (products table, orders display logic)
- Product and Order models and relationships
- Order creation and processing workflows
- Livewire components for orders and product management
- Inventory management system
- Service and repository layers

**Business Logic:**
- Users buy/sell on behalf of their companies, not as individuals
- Company inventory tracking replaces individual ownership
- Automated inventory transfers maintain accurate company-wise stock levels
- Enhanced order displays show business relationships clearly

**Implementation Approach:**
- Phased implementation starting with database changes
- Focus on basic functionality before complex features
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Comprehensive testing at each phase

- **Test Users with Correct Companies**: All test users (admin@gmail.com, vendor@gmail.com, etc.) properly assigned to companies
- **UserFactory Enhanced**: Generates realistic company names based on user role
- **OrderFactory Updated**: Uses actual product IDs and realistic order structures

**Files Modified:**
1. `UserSeeder.php` - Test users with correct company assignments
