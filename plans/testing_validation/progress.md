# Testing & Validation Implementation Progress

## Status: In Progress üöß

### Step 1: Test Strategy & Environment Setup ‚úÖ
- [x] Define test approach (unit, integration, feature, end-to-end)
- [x] Set up testing environments (local, CI/CD)
- [x] Configure testing tools and frameworks
- [x] Define test coverage targets and quality gates

### Step 2: Unit Testing Enhancement ‚è≥
- [x] Review and update existing unit tests
- [ ] Implement missing unit tests for core services
- [ ] Focus on critical business logic components
- [ ] Ensure proper mocking and isolation of dependencies

### Step 3: Feature & Integration Testing ‚è≥
- [ ] Implement feature tests for main user flows
- [ ] Create integration tests for service interactions
- [ ] Test database interactions and repositories
- [ ] Validate third-party service integrations

### Step 4: UI & Component Testing ‚è≥
- [x] Test Livewire components functionality
- [ ] Validate form submissions and validations
- [x] Test UI components across different browsers
- [ ] Implement accessibility testing

### Step 5: Performance Testing ‚è≥
- [ ] Profile database queries and optimize slow queries
- [ ] Implement load testing for critical endpoints
- [ ] Test system performance under stress
- [ ] Identify and resolve bottlenecks

### Step 6: Security Testing ‚è≥
- [ ] Conduct authorization and authentication tests
- [ ] Validate input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Test for common security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review and test API endpoints security

### Step 7: Error Handling & Edge Cases ‚è≥
- [ ] Test system behavior with invalid inputs
- [ ] Validate error messages and feedback
- [ ] Test recovery from failure scenarios
- [ ] Test boundary conditions and edge cases

### Step 8: Cross-Browser & Responsive Testing ‚è≥
- [ ] Test across major browsers
- [ ] Validate responsive behavior across device sizes
- [ ] Test touch interactions on mobile devices
- [ ] Ensure consistent experience across platforms

### Step 9: User Acceptance Testing ‚è≥
- [ ] Create UAT scripts and scenarios
- [ ] Conduct structured testing with stakeholders
- [ ] Document feedback and prioritize issues
- [ ] Implement critical fixes based on feedback

### Step 10: Test Automation & Continuous Integration ‚è≥
- [ ] Implement automated test suites
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline with test gates
- [ ] Set up automated testing reports
- [ ] Configure alerts for test failures
