# Software Design Document (SDD)

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Design Document (SDD) describes the architecture and system design of the Aktina Supply Chain & Product Management Platform. It is intended for developers, project managers, stakeholders, and system administrators involved in the implementation, deployment, and maintenance of the platform.

### 1.2 Scope
The platform covers end-to-end supply chain processes, including supplier onboarding, inventory tracking, order processing, workforce scheduling, product lifecycle management, analytics, and machine learning integration. It supports current and future product lines as outlined in the product ideas repository.

### 1.3 Overview
This document follows the IEEE SDD template, providing a structured overview of system architecture, data design, component design, user interface, requirements traceability, and supporting appendices.

## 2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The Aktina platform is an enterprise solution for managing the supply chain of a technology hardware company. It addresses challenges in supplier management, product lifecycle, inventory, order processing, and analytics. The system is designed for scalability, flexibility, and integration with external services.

## 3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 3.1 Architectural Design
The system uses a modular, microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns. Major modules include:
- Supply Chain Management
- Product Lifecycle Management
- Vendor Validation & Management
- Machine Learning & Intelligence
- Analytics & Reporting
- Communication & Messaging

Each module exposes APIs and interacts through well-defined interfaces. Data is centralized in a relational database, with caching and message queues for performance and reliability.

### 3.2 Decomposition Description
Each module is decomposed into submodules:
- Supply Chain: Inventory, Order, Supplier Management
- Product Lifecycle: Product Design, BOM Management
- Vendor Validation: Application Processing, Business Rules
- ML & Intelligence: Demand Forecasting, Customer Segmentation, Anomaly Detection
- Analytics: Dashboard, Reporting
- Communication: Messaging, Notification

### 3.3 Design Rationale
A modular approach enables independent development, scalability, and technology diversity. Microservices principles allow for future migration to distributed deployments. RESTful APIs and event-driven patterns are used for integration.

## 4. DATA DESIGN

### 4.1 Data Description
The system manages users, products, suppliers, components, orders, inventory, events, and analytics data. Data is stored in a normalized relational schema, with Redis for caching and a file store for documents.

### 4.2 Data Dictionary
Entities include:
- users: user profiles, roles, permissions
- products: product definitions, categories, lifecycle
- suppliers: company info, performance, compliance
- components: parts, specifications, sourcing
- orders: customer, procurement, internal orders
- inventory: stock levels, locations
- events: system and business events
- messages: internal communications

## 5. COMPONENT DESIGN

Each module is described by its purpose and main responsibilities:
- Authentication: User login, role-based access, session management
- Product Management: Product creation, BOM, lifecycle tracking
- Inventory: Stock tracking, reorder alerts, location management
- Order Processing: Order creation, fulfillment, status tracking
- Supplier Management: Onboarding, performance, compliance
- Vendor Validation: Application intake, document analysis, business rules
- Analytics: KPI dashboards, reporting, data export
- ML Services: Demand forecasting, segmentation, anomaly detection
- Messaging: Internal chat, notifications, alerts
- API Gateway: Request routing, authentication, logging
- Caching: Data caching, session storage
- Security: Authentication, authorization, encryption, input validation

## 6. HUMAN INTERFACE DESIGN

### 6.1 Overview of User Interface
The UI is web-based and responsive, supporting desktop and mobile. Navigation is role-based, with dashboards, management pages, and analytics views. Feedback is provided through notifications and real-time updates.

### 6.2 Screen Images
Screens include:
- Dashboard (KPIs, alerts)
- Product Management (list, detail, BOM)
- Supplier Management (list, application review)
- Inventory (stock levels, locations)
- Orders (list, detail, status)
- Analytics (charts, reports)
- Messaging (inbox, chat)

### 6.3 Screen Objects and Actions
Each page contains tables, forms, filters, and action buttons. Users can view, create, update, and search records based on permissions. Alerts and notifications are shown contextually.

## 7. REQUIREMENTS MATRIX

A traceability matrix maps functional and non-functional requirements to modules and data entities. Each requirement is linked to the responsible module(s) and supporting data structures.

## 8. APPENDICES

- CPU: Quad-core or higher
- RAM: 8GB minimum
- Storage: 100GB+ SSD
