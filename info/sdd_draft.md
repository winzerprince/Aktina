## 1. INTRODUCTION
Briefly introduce the project and this document.

### 1.1 Purpose
Identify the purpose of this SDD and its intended audience. (e.g., “This software design document describes the architecture and system design of [Project Name]. It is intended for the development team, project managers, and stakeholders.”).

[Insert Purpose Here]

### 1.2 Scope
Provide a description and scope of the software. Explain the main goals, objectives, and benefits of your project. This section should clearly define what the system will and will not do.

[Insert Scope Here]

### 1.3 Overview

### 1.4 Reference Material
(Optional) List any documents, websites, or other materials used as sources of information or that provide context for this SDD (e.g., Software Requirements Specification, technical standards, system documentation).

[Insert Reference Material Here, or state "N/A"]

### 1.5 Definitions and Acronyms
(Optional) Provide definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used in this SDD that might not be commonly understood by the intended audience.

## 2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
Give a general description of the software system's functionality, its context (how it fits with other systems or business processes), and a high-level overview of its design. Provide any background information necessary for understanding the system.

[Insert System Overview Here]

## 3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
This section describes the overall structure of the software.

### 3.1 Architectural Design
Describe the high-level architecture of the system. Identify the major components or subsystems and explain how they interact with each other to achieve the system's functionality. Include a diagram (e.g., block diagram, component diagram) showing these major subsystems, data repositories, and their interconnections. Describe the diagram as needed.

[Insert Architectural Design Description and Diagram Here]

### 3.2 Decomposition Description
Provide a more detailed breakdown of the subsystems identified in the Architectural Design. You can describe this functionally (e.g., using Data Flow Diagrams, structure charts) or using an object-oriented approach (e.g., using class diagrams, object diagrams, sequence diagrams). Supplement with text as needed.

[Insert Decomposition Description and Diagrams Here]

### 3.3 Design Rationale
Discuss the reasons for choosing the specific architecture described in section 3.1. Explain critical issues, trade-offs considered (e.g., performance vs. maintainability), and why this architecture was selected over potential alternatives.

[Insert Design Rationale Here]

## 4. DATA DESIGN
This section focuses on how data is structured, stored, and processed within the system.

### 4.1 Data Description
Explain how the information domain of your system (as defined by requirements) is transformed into data structures. Describe how major data entities are stored, processed, and organized. List any databases or significant data storage items.

[Insert Data Description Here]

### 4.2 Data Dictionary
Alphabetically list and describe the important data elements or entities in the system.
If using a functional approach (from 3.2), list functions and their parameters.
If using an object-oriented approach (from 3.2), list classes with their attributes (including data types), methods, and method parameters.

[Insert Data Dictionary Here, possibly in a table format]

## 5. COMPONENT DESIGN
Provide detailed descriptions of the internal workings of the software components or modules identified in the System Architecture (section 3). For each component/module (or function/method):
- Provide a summary of its algorithm using pseudocode or a Procedural Description Language (PDL).
- Describe any local data structures used by the component.

[Insert Component Design Details Here, repeating for each component]

### Component Name: [Example Component 1]
- **Algorithm/Logic (Pseudocode):**
  [Insert Pseudocode Here]
- **Local Data Structures:**

## 6. HUMAN INTERFACE DESIGN
Describe how users will interact with the software.

### 6.1 Overview of User Interface
Describe the system's functionality from the user's perspective. Explain the overall flow of interaction, how users will use the system to accomplish tasks, and the feedback the system will provide.

[Insert Overview of User Interface Here]

### 6.2 Screen Images
Provide visual mockups, sketches, or screenshots of the software's screens or main user interface elements. These should be as accurate as possible to convey the user experience.

[Insert Screen Images or Links to Mockups Here]

### 6.3 Screen Objects and Actions
For each screen or significant UI view shown in 6.2, describe the important screen objects (e.g., buttons, menus, forms, text fields) and the actions associated with them (e.g., "Clicking the 'Submit' button validates the form data and sends it to the server.").

[Insert Screen Objects and Actions Here, possibly on a per-screen basis]

## 7. REQUIREMENTS MATRIX
Provide a table that traces the software design components, modules, and data structures back to the specific requirements (e.g., from a Software Requirements Specification - SRS document). This demonstrates that all requirements have been addressed in the design. Refer to functional requirements by their unique identifiers from the SRS.

| Requirement ID (from SRS) | Requirement Description (Brief) | Design Component(s) Satisfying Requirement |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| [Req ID 1]                | [Brief desc of Req 1]           | [Component A, Module X]                    |
| [Req ID 2]                | [Brief desc of Req 2]           | [Component B, Data Structure Y]            |
| ...                       | ...                             | ...                                        |
