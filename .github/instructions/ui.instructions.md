The follwoing instructions are to guide you in implementing the UI/UX design
- The application is already set with views for each role, your goal is to populate
these views with livewire components, charts and nice ui design relevant to the role.
- When designing, use plain html , tailwind css, apex charts and livewire components.
- Avoid using any other external libraries not specified in this instuction.
- Ensure the design is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Use the existing components from the `resources/views/components` directory as a reference for creating new components.
- Follow the existing design patterns and conventions used in the application.
- Ensure that the sidebar and header are consistent across all views and all views must have the sidebar
showing at all times.
- Use the existing layout files in `resources/views/layouts` as a reference for creating new layouts and color themes.
- Ensure that the views are accessible and follow best practices for web accessibility.
- Use the existing routes in `routes/web.php` as a reference for creating new routes and
- Where necessary, create new routes, views , controllers and livewire components.
- For views that are common across multiple roles, create a shared component that can be reused based on the current users company_name.
- Ensure that the views are optimized for performance and do not contain any unnecessary code or dependencies.
- Use the existing CSS classes and styles in `resources/css/app.css` as a reference for creating new styles.
- Ensure that the views are consistent with the overall design of the application and follow
the existing design patterns.
- Always ask for clarification if you are unsure about any aspect of the design or implementation.
- Before populating a view, ask a minimum of 5 questions to clarify the requirements and ensure that you understand the design and functionality needed.
- Always use the instuctioins for planning to create a plan outlining the steps needed to implement the design.
- Ensure that the plan is comprehensive and covers all aspects of the design and functionality needed.
- Use the existing plans in the `plans` directory as a reference for creating new plans.
- Do not be verbose in your responses, be concise and to the point.
- Use existing design patterns and conventions used in the application.Where necessary,
use mcp to search for inspiration and examples of similar designs.
